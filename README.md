# Mini-MBA  Program
The Mini MBA Program was organized by Graduate Management Consulting Association at the University of British Columbia in the spring of 2018.  The program is designed to deliver useful business information clearly and concisely within 10 sessions to Humanities and STEM professionals. More information can be found [here](https://www.gmcacanada.com/ubc-gmca-mini-mba-program/).
During the course of the program, we learnt MBA knowledge that can be applied to everyday business situations. This course also provides opportunities to network through sessions run by experienced professionals.
The topics reflect Steven Silbiger's concepts around the following:  
- Strategy
- Organizational Behaviour
- Marketing
- Entrepreneurship
- Accounting
- Finance
- Operations
- Economics
- Consulting

The sessions are split up into 3 main components. We read the corresponding chapter prior to the sessions. 
The first half hour of sessions are consisted of a review of the material. This was followed by a seminar from the instructor including a question and answer or panel discussion period. 
Finally, there was a team activity to demonstrate and utilize the content covered that day.
An overarching capstone project was used to develop a proposal utilizing multiple MBA subjects. 
This exercise allowed us to incorporation many of MBA topics in handling a real business case.
